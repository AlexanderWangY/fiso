**fiso** (filesystem organizer) is a fast and flexible CLI tool for cleaning and restructuring your filesystem. It helps you find duplicate files, sort cluttered directories, and automatically move or organize files according to rulesets you define.

You can preview dry-runs for safety and also see auditable logs for actions fiso runs on your filesystem.

fiso’s goal is to give you a simple command-line workflow for keeping places like `~/Downloads` tidy, managing duplicates across large drives, and shaping your filesystem into something that works the way you do.
